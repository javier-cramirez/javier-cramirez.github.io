Stare. All I have to do is stare. 
Every little word, a sapling pharynx would never know it’s there. 
Cut it from my view, it’s not so often you’ll see me blue.
Coal to coal and flesh by flesh.
My empty soles no longer come to mesh.
A forever song, to keep me tight.
That’s all she’ll ever need to see, thus right. 
One kiss goodnight, till tomorrow.
Like my good climb up.
A good struggle to keep the World ripe. 
Lure me in with your special secret.
Tremble, I tremble.
You, as my witness.
Never again will I fight.
Struggle. Only you can do it right.
